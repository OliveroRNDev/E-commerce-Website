Project built using Node.js and Express with a MongoDB database to save data and an s3
bucket to save images for the website. All the pages are server-side rendered using ejs and a node server.
The website offers two sides: users and admins. On the user side there is a shop where you can search
for specific products, filter for price and buy using stripe as a service provider.
In the admin section you can add/modify/delete products, with various sizes and colors, and also create categories and subcategories.
Every category, and subcategory, has an image that can link to a website or page and in the homepage you can add specific products to highlight them( there is a specific page designed for that).
When an user buys a product he can then enter a review for that specific product.
There are many more features implemented in the website feel free to read up on it and ask questions if you have any or suggest some modifications.
